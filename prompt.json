  "improved_prompt": "Create a comprehensive practical training course (100% hands-on with professional workshops) focused on e-Banking for ODDO BH enterprise in a Kubernetes environment using Grafana, Loki, and related observability tools. Structure the course into 5 modules covering: (1) Grafana OSS fundamentals including dashboard templating, provisioning, annotations, alerting, permissions, and SQL data sources; (2) Integration with InfluxDB and Prometheus for metrics collection; (3) Best practices including observability strategies, dashboard maturity models, exemplars, time series analysis, and connections to MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQL Server; (4) Organization and dashboard management including RBAC, user administration, and multi-tenancy; (5) Advanced templating with query variables and variable syntax. Each module must include at least 2 practical workshops using real e-banking scenarios (transaction monitoring, API performance tracking, customer journey analytics, fraud detection dashboards, or payment gateway observability). Workshops must provide step-by-step instructions with screenshots, YAML configuration files for K8s deployments, sample queries (PromQL/LogQL), and validation checkpoints. Target audience: DevOps engineers and SREs with basic Kubernetes knowledge. Course duration: 16-20 hours. Deliverables: course outline with learning objectives per module, workshop instructions with code samples, and assessment criteria.",
  
  "success_checklist": [
    "Course contains exactly 5 modules matching the provided structure with Grafana OSS, data source integrations, best practices, organization management, and templating",
    "Each module includes at least 2 hands-on workshops with e-banking examples relevant to ODDO BH enterprise context",
    "Workshop instructions include step-by-step procedures, Kubernetes YAML manifests, Grafana dashboard JSON, and sample PromQL/LogQL queries",
    "Course targets 100% practical learning with no more than 20% theory content per module",
    "All workshops include validation checkpoints where learners verify their implementations against expected outputs",
    "Content covers Kubernetes-specific deployment scenarios for Grafana, Prometheus, Loki stack with proper RBAC and persistence configurations",
    "Deliverables include complete course outline, workshop materials with code samples, and clear assessment rubrics"
  ],
  
  "assumptions": [
    "ODDO BH is a financial services enterprise requiring monitoring of e-banking applications including transaction processing, API gateways, and customer-facing services",
    "Target learners have basic Kubernetes knowledge including pod, service, deployment concepts and can execute kubectl commands",
    "Training environment provides access to a Kubernetes cluster where learners can deploy Grafana stack components without production system risks",
    "E-banking workshop scenarios should cover common observability use cases: transaction latency monitoring, error rate tracking, log aggregation for audit trails, and SLA dashboard creation",
    "Course should emphasize production-ready configurations including high availability, persistent storage, and security best practices for financial services compliance"
  ],
  
  "output_contract": {
    "format": "Markdown",
    "structure": "Document structured with H1 for course title, H2 for each of 5 modules, H3 for module sections (theory/workshops), H4 for workshop steps. Include code blocks with language tags (yaml/promql/json). Each workshop must have: objective, prerequisites, step-by-step instructions with commands, expected outputs, and validation criteria. Append assessment rubric table at end."
  },
  
  "risk_flags": [
    "Course content involves financial services monitoring which may require compliance review for data sensitivity handling in examples",
    "Real ODDO BH system architecture details should be sanitized or anonymized in workshop examples to avoid exposing proprietary infrastructure",
    "Kubernetes security configurations (RBAC, network policies, secrets management) must follow financial industry best practices to avoid creating insecure training habits"
