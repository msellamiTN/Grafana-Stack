# 🏷️ eBanking Exporter - Environment Labels Enhancement

## ✅ Enhancement Status: COMPLETE

**Date**: October 21, 2024  
**Component**: eBanking Metrics Exporter  
**Enhancement**: Environment Labels for Multi-Environment Support  
**Status**: Ready for use

---

## 🎯 What Was Enhanced

### **Environment Labels Added to All Metrics**

Enhanced the eBanking exporter with `environment` labels on all Prometheus metrics to follow industry best practices and enable dynamic alert routing.

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Multi-environment support (training, development, staging, production)
- ✅ Dynamic alert routing based on environment
- ✅ Better metric filtering and organization
- ✅ Production-ready configuration
- ✅ Follows Prometheus best practices

---

## 📦 Files Modified

1. ✅ `ebanking-exporter/main.py` - Added environment labels to all metrics
2. ✅ `docker-compose.yml` - Added environment variables
3. ✅ `.env.example` - Added environment configuration

---

## 🏷️ Environment Label Implementation

### **Supported Environments**

| Environment | Purpose | Alert Routing |
|-------------|---------|---------------|
| **training** | Training/demo environment | Low priority |
| **development** | Development environment | Team notifications |
| **staging** | Pre-production testing | Escalated alerts |
| **production** | Live production | Critical alerts |

### **Configuration Variables**

```bash
ENVIRONMENT=training          # Environment name
SERVICE_NAME=ebanking-api    # Service identifier
REGION=eu-west-1             # Geographic region
CLUSTER=training-cluster     # Cluster identifier
```

---

## 📊 Enhanced Metrics

### **All Metrics Now Include Environment Label**

#### **Transaction Metrics**
```promql
# Before
ebanking_transactions_processed_total{transaction_type="transfer",status="success",channel="web"}

# After (with environment label)
ebanking_transactions_processed_total{transaction_type="transfer",status="success",channel="web",environment="training"}
```

#### **Session Metrics**
```promql
# Before
ebanking_active_sessions

# After (with environment label)
ebanking_active_sessions{environment="training"}
```

#### **API Performance Metrics**
```promql
# Before
ebanking_request_duration_seconds{endpoint="/api/v1/transfer",method="POST"}

# After (with environment label)
ebanking_request_duration_seconds{endpoint="/api/v1/transfer",method="POST",environment="training"}
```

#### **Error Metrics**
```promql
# Before
ebanking_api_errors_total{error_type="timeout",severity="high"}

# After (with environment label)
ebanking_api_errors_total{error_type="timeout",severity="high",environment="training"}
```

---

## 🎯 Use Cases

### **1. Multi-Environment Monitoring**

Query metrics from specific environments:

```promql
# Training environment only
ebanking_transactions_processed_total{environment="training"}

# Production environment only
ebanking_transactions_processed_total{environment="production"}

# Compare across environments
sum by (environment) (rate(ebanking_transactions_processed_total[5m]))
```

### **2. Dynamic Alert Routing**

Configure alerts based on environment:

```yaml
# Alertmanager configuration
route:
  receiver: 'default'
  routes:
    # Production alerts - Critical
    - match:
        environment: production
      receiver: 'pagerduty-critical'
      group_wait: 10s
      group_interval: 1m
      repeat_interval: 1h
    
    # Staging alerts - Escalated
    - match:
        environment: staging
      receiver: 'slack-ops'
      group_wait: 30s
      group_interval: 5m
      repeat_interval: 4h
    
    # Development alerts - Team notifications
    - match:
        environment: development
      receiver: 'slack-dev'
      group_wait: 1m
      group_interval: 10m
      repeat_interval: 12h
    
    # Training alerts - Low priority
    - match:
        environment: training
      receiver: 'email-training'
      group_wait: 5m
      group_interval: 30m
      repeat_interval: 24h
```

### **3. Environment-Specific Dashboards**

Create dashboards filtered by environment:

```json
{
  "templating": {
    "list": [
      {
        "name": "environment",
        "type": "query",
        "query": "label_values(ebanking_transactions_processed_total, environment)",
        "current": {
          "text": "training",
          "value": "training"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### **4. Alert Rules with Environment Context**

```yaml
groups:
  - name: ebanking_alerts
    rules:
      # High error rate (environment-specific thresholds)
      - alert: HighErrorRate
        expr: |
          (
            sum by (environment) (rate(ebanking_api_errors_total{severity="high"}[5m]))
            /
            sum by (environment) (rate(ebanking_api_requests_total[5m]))
          ) > 0.05
        for: 5m
        labels:
          severity: critical
        annotations:
          summary: "High error rate in {{ $labels.environment }} environment"
          description: "Error rate is {{ $value | humanizePercentage }} in {{ $labels.environment }}"
      
      # Environment-specific thresholds
      - alert: HighTransactionVolume
        expr: |
          sum by (environment) (rate(ebanking_transactions_processed_total[5m])) > 
          (
            100 * on(environment) group_left
            label_replace(
              (environment == "production") * 1 +
              (environment == "staging") * 0.5 +
              (environment == "development") * 0.2 +
              (environment == "training") * 0.1,
              "environment", "$1", "environment", "(.*)"
            )
          )
        labels:
          severity: warning
        annotations:
          summary: "High transaction volume in {{ $labels.environment }}"
```

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### **Docker Compose**

```yaml
ebanking-exporter:
  environment:
    - ENVIRONMENT=${ENVIRONMENT:-training}
    - SERVICE_NAME=ebanking-api
    - REGION=${REGION:-eu-west-1}
    - CLUSTER=${CLUSTER:-training-cluster}
```

### **Environment Variables (.env)**

```bash
# Environment Configuration
ENVIRONMENT=training
REGION=eu-west-1
CLUSTER=training-cluster
```

### **Change Environment**

```bash
# For production deployment
export ENVIRONMENT=production
export CLUSTER=production-cluster

# Restart service
docker-compose up -d ebanking-exporter
```

---

## 📈 Query Examples

### **Filter by Environment**

```promql
# All transactions in training
ebanking_transactions_processed_total{environment="training"}

# Error rate by environment
sum by (environment) (rate(ebanking_api_errors_total[5m]))

# Compare production vs staging
ebanking_active_sessions{environment=~"production|staging"}
```

### **Aggregate Across Environments**

```promql
# Total transactions across all environments
sum(ebanking_transactions_processed_total)

# Per-environment breakdown
sum by (environment) (ebanking_transactions_processed_total)

# Environment with highest error rate
topk(1, sum by (environment) (rate(ebanking_api_errors_total[5m])))
```

### **Environment-Specific Alerts**

```promql
# Production errors only
sum(rate(ebanking_api_errors_total{environment="production",severity="critical"}[5m])) > 0

# Training environment health check
up{job="ebanking-exporter",environment="training"} == 0
```

## 🔄 Migration Guide

### **For Existing Deployments**

If you have existing Prometheus queries or dashboards:

**Before**:
```promql
ebanking_transactions_processed_total{transaction_type="transfer"}
```

**After**:
```promql
ebanking_transactions_processed_total{transaction_type="transfer",environment="training"}
```

**Backward Compatible Query** (works with both):
```promql
ebanking_transactions_processed_total{transaction_type="transfer"}
# This will match all environments
```

**Environment-Specific Query**:
```promql
ebanking_transactions_processed_total{transaction_type="transfer",environment="production"}
# This will match only production
```
