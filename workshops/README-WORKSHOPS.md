## üì∏ Screenshot Guidelines

All workshops use **screenshot placeholders** marked with üì∏ emoji. Each placeholder includes:

1. **Context:** Where in the UI this screenshot appears
2. **Content:** What should be visible in the screenshot
3. **Purpose:** What the screenshot validates

**Example:**
```
üì∏ Screenshot: Grafana login page
[Screenshot showing:
- Grafana logo at top
- "Welcome to Grafana" heading
- Email or username field
- Password field
- "Log in" button
- Dark theme interface
]
```

### Creating Actual Screenshots

When conducting workshops:
1. Follow each step exactly as written
2. Capture screenshots at each üì∏ marker
3. Replace placeholder descriptions with actual images
4. Annotate screenshots with red arrows/boxes for clarity
5. Save as PNG or JPEG with descriptive filenames

**Recommended naming:**
- `module1-workshop1-step3-pvc-bound.png`
- `module2-workshop1-step7-prometheus-targets.png`

---

## ‚úÖ Validation Checkpoints

Each workshop includes **validation checkpoints** marked with ‚úÖ. These are critical verification points where participants must confirm success before proceeding.

**Checkpoint Types:**

1. **Resource Status:** Kubernetes pods running, services created
2. **Connectivity:** Database connections, API responses
3. **Data Verification:** Query results, record counts
4. **UI Confirmation:** Dashboard displays, alert states
5. **Functional Testing:** Links work, variables update panels

**Example:**
```
‚úÖ Checkpoint 3: Grafana pod must be "Running" with READY status "1/1"
```

If checkpoint fails, workshop includes troubleshooting steps.

## üéì Workshop Delivery Tips

### For Instructors

**Preparation:**
1. Complete each workshop yourself before class
2. Capture all screenshots with annotations
3. Test in same environment students will use
4. Prepare backup plans for common issues
5. Have troubleshooting guide handy

**During Workshop:**
1. Demonstrate first 2-3 steps
2. Let students work independently with checkpoints
3. Monitor progress using checkpoints as milestones
4. Address common issues for entire group
5. Encourage peer helping

**Timing:**
- Beginner workshops: Add 15-20 min buffer
- Advanced workshops: Add 20-30 min buffer
- Include 10 min break for 90+ min workshops

### For Self-Paced Learning

**Success Tips:**
1. Follow steps exactly as written
2. Don't skip validation checkpoints
3. If stuck, check troubleshooting guide
4. Take your own screenshots for notes
5. Experiment after completing workshop

**Common Issues:**
- PVC stays Pending: Check storage class
- Pod CrashLoopBackOff: Check logs with kubectl logs
- Connection failures: Verify service names and ports
- Query errors: Check data source permissions
